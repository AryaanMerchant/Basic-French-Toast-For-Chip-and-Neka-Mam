  step1 : take a bowl which is big enough to fit a slice of bread.

  step2 : mix milk,egg,vanilla custard powder,sugar and cinnamon powder(optional) in the bowl.

  step3 : whisk the ingredients till the egg is beaten and it looks like cake batter.

  step4 : take a pan, wash it and put it on the gas and turn on the heat at medium.

  step5 : now put the ghee but be careful that there should be no water in the pan.

  step6 : once the ghee is spread all over the pan and heated take a slice of bread and dip it in the batter.

  step7 : make sure the bread soakes the batter and then shallow fry it in the ghee.

  step8 : make sure to cook both the sides of the bread.

  step9 : once the bread is cooked remove it from the pan and then it is ready to be served.
