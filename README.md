My recipe for chip the foodie is basic French toast 

now u might be thinking that everywhere i have written    < BASIC >   French toast 
that is because there are many varities in making French toast but mine is the most simplest and 
easiest one :)


French toast is where a slice of bread is dipped in batter and shallow fried in ghee.
